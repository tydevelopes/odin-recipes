# PROJECT: RECIPES

## Description

This project builds a simple recipe site. Home page will have a list of recipes with links. Each link when clicked will open a new page with the recipe details.

## Reflection

### What I learned

- Open a link in a new tab using the attribute `target='_blank'`
- Go to the top of a page from the bottom of the page
  - Add id to body`<body id='top'></body>
  - Then at the bottom add `<a href='#top'>Go To Top</a>
